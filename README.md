# tech-for-home
This is a rough blueprint which gathers inspirations for what Ingrid want to build.
For now what have came to her mind during daily life are:
  1. pocket book for common account with Lucas
  2. what-to-cook/eat-today

While the current ideas are pretty simple and to some extends childish and naive, but she hopes that it could finally become something lovely.
