This is a rough blueprint which gathers inspirations for what Ingrid want to build.
For now what have came to her mind during daily life are:
  1. pocket book for common account with Lucas
  2. what-to-cook/eat-today



How to allow user to enter the data and then transform the data into csv?
Or the data could be used directly.

While the current ideas are pretty simple and to some extends childish and naive, but she hopes that it could finally become something lovely.

Ingrid came up with the idea of this project and created basic visualization in Python, then realized it requires a csv file, which means she needs to manually enter the data into Excel and transform the file into csv format. It seems not convenient and not quite idel. 

Discussed with Lucas, decided to use React + Java as front and backend. Considering use d3 for visualization instead. Database TBD.
As there is an available cloud vm,  this project may have chance to go live:)
